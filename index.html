                    <p>
                        Since I was a child I used to be a bookworm. Discovering
                        new stories worlds and universes is what makes my imagination fly, reading is something
                        I could never leave and will ever be part of my life.

                <h2>What about cryptography?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptography is a field of computer science and mathematics that focusses on techniques for secure
                    communication between two parties (Alice & Bob) while a third-party is present.This is based on methods 
                    like encryption, decryption, signing, generating of pseudo random numbers, etc.

                <p>
                    Claude E. Shannon is considered by many to be the father of mathematical cryptography. Shannon worked 
                    for several years at Bell Labs, and during his time there, he produced an article entitled "A mathematical theory of cryptography".

            <div class="crypto-info-row">
                <p>
                    Shannon's work influenced further cryptography research in the 1970s, as the public-key cryptography developers, M. E. Hellman and W. Diffie cited Shannon's research as a major influence. 
                    His work also impacted modern designs of secret-key ciphers. At the end of Shannon's work with cryptography, progress slowed until Hellman and Diffie introduced their paper involving "public-key cryptography".
